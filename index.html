          How would I, as a Product Owner, prioritize two unrelated, yet equally
          important, product requests from two separate departments?

              Project management tools, when used correctly, can aid when organizing tasks and prioritizing projects. However, the tools are only as good as the team using them.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Product Owner, I would review the project management tools used to see if there's any glaring indication that one project is more of a priority over the other.

              Prioritize projects by identifying urgent versus important
            </legend>
            <p>
              Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Product Owner, I would use the Eisenhower Matix to compare and contrast each project asking if one of the two projects is not considered urgent and important?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Projects that are both urgent and important require immediate attention.</li>
              <li>Projects that are not urgent and important do not require immediate attention. You can schedule these projects for a later date.</li>
              <li>Projects that are urgent and unimportant do not require immediate attention. You can delegate these projects to someone else.</li>
              <li>Projects that are not urgent and unimportant do not require immediate attention. You can delete these projects.</li>
            </ul>
          </fieldset>

          <fieldset class="solution-border">
            <legend class="solution-border">
              Consider time and effort.
            </legend>
            <p>
              Evaluating projects based on time and effort may be required pending both projects are urgent and important and require immediate attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Product Owner, I would prioritize the project that requires less time and effort. By completing one of the two projects, I can focus my time and efforts on the other.
            </p>
          </fieldset>

          <fieldset class="solution-border">
            <legend class="solution-border">Be accountable</legend>
            <p>
              As a Product Owner, it's my responsibility to maximize the value
              of a product or project. And part of that responsibility is to
              make necessary, sometimes difficult decisions to move the product
              or project forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              To sustain a collaborative relationship built on trust with both project teams, I would maintain an open and transparent line of communication.

              The solution to the problem described previously is reactionary,
              but how can we learn from this challenge and become more
              intentional? The list below is by no means exhaustive but provides several key characteristics that may increase effectiveness and efficiencies when prioritizing projects.  
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be Open and Transparent.</li>
              <li>Moving forward, set the right expectations and establish clear deadlines.</li>
              <li>Continue to build trust with partners through continuous collaboration and communication.</li>
              <li>Practice patience. Take the necessary time to pause and think.</li>
              <li>Ask probing questions to gain clarity regarding a project's roadmap.</li>
              <li>Update project management tools daily.</li>

              <li>If required, learn to say no to a project.</li>
              <li>Using retrospectives, gain continuous feedback to find ways to improve and grow.</li>
